            <h2>recipe for cake:</h2>
            <div class="shorten-me"><ol>
                <li>
                    We need to get eggs from fridge earlier and wait some time
                    until they temp become normal.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Its better to use high value choco, min 70%, raw cocoa and 
                    normal butter, not plant based. Insted of normal sugar we can 
                    use cane sugar. 
                    </canvas>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Now we have to melt butter and chocolate. To do so its better to
                    cut butter and choco, and mix in pot on slow heat. Next, when we 
                    mix these two we can add milk, and again mix these ingredients.
                    Do not boil this, it have to be cream.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Next we make a foam / cream from eggs and sugar. With mixer we blend
                    these two about 4-5 min.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In other bowl we mix flour, cocoa and baking soda. After that add our
                    foam and lighly mix with spoon. Now we can blend that mass, and after
                    a while we add rum and choco cream. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <!-- &deg is symbol for degrees celcius -->
                    Now we need a form i use 11x30 cm, spread with butter, then i 
                    lined it with paper. We need to bake with top/down function 
                    with 170&deg;C. After 50 min we need to check on cake and with
                    slightly open door we wait another 5 min.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I recommend to add some fruits, especially raspberries or strawberries.
                </li>
